## 🤖 How the Automation Works

This portal is designed to run completely autonomously using GitHub Actions. Here is the full lifecycle of a student's submission:

1. **Pull Request Validation** (`validate-pr.yml`):
   When a student opens a PR, a GitHub Action runs `validate-submission.mjs`. It strictly verifies that the student *only* edited their designated `activities/YYYY-MM-DD/<roll-number>` folder and that they included all required files (e.g., `README.md`, `reflection.md`, `prompts.md`).
2. **Auto-Merge**:
   If the validation checks pass successfully, the GitHub Action bot automatically approves the pull request and squash-merges it into the `main` branch. No manual review is required from maintainers.
3. **Recalculate & Leaderboard Update** (`on-merge.yml`):
   Immediately after the PR is auto-merged, another action is triggered. It runs the automated scoring system, updates the underlying JSON databases, and regenerates the leaderboard in this README.
4. **Vercel Auto-Deploy**:
   Finally, the action commits the updated scores back to the repository and triggers a Vercel deploy hook, ensuring the [live dashboard](https://class.psgmx.tech/) reflects the newest submissions instantly.

## Automated Scoring System

The portal uses an automated bot (`scripts/recalculate-scores.mjs`) to assign scores for each day's submission. The maximum score for standard days is **30 points**, but **Day 1 and Day 2** have a max of **25 points** (Prompting is disabled).

Here is exactly how the daily marks are calculated:

- **Submission (`+10 pts`)**: Automatically given if you created your folder and pushed code.
- **Documentation (`+0 to +5 pts`)**: An automated heuristic checks your main deliverable file (e.g., `profile.md` for Day 1, or `README.md` for other days). If any `.md` file in your folder has markdown headers (`#`) and more than 80 characters of meaningful content, you get 5 points. If your markdown files are missing, mostly empty, or just copy-pasted templates, you get 0 points.
- **Quality (`+5 pts`)**: Given by default (until manual review).
- **Reflection (`+5 pts`)**: Given by default (until manual review).
- **Prompting (`+5 pts`)**: 0 points on Day 1 & Day 2 (disabled). Otherwise, given by default (until manual review).

> [!TIP]
> If you received `20 points` instead of `25 points`, your Markdown file (`profile.md` or `README.md`) failed the documentation check! Make sure you are writing actual content, using markdown headers, and avoiding blank templates.
